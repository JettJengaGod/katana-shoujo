SP0B3C0<What was I thinking? She always treats me rudely>
SP0B3C0<Why am I running after her...>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Wait! Ana! Stop!>
SP0B3C33<Ana&What do you want>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Listen, you can hate me and not talk to me for$the rest of high school, but please>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Hear me out.>
SP0B3C33<Ana&And why should I do that? Why should I trust you!>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Because...Well, because...I don't know!>
SP0B3C31<Hisao&But I do know that I will do anything to prove$that nothing happened!>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ana, wait! I just wanted to make sure you know$that nothing happened between us!>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Your little Hisao is safe and sound, don't worry>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ga Ha Ha!>
SP0B3TC33C25<Ana&Hmph! It's not like I cared anyways>
SP0B3TC33C25<Ana&Well Hisao, I hope you brought me food$because you owe me now>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Hisao made food? I want some!>
SP0B3TC33C22<Ana&NO!..I mean, no you can't have them$...because they are mine.">
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ga ha! I was only joking Ana, how greedy of you.$Anyways, I'm going to go now, see you guys!>
SP0B3C31<Ana&Geez, she should learn to keep her nose$out of my business. Anyways, let go Hisao.>
SP0B3C31<Hisao&Oh, ok>
SP0B1C0<After Lunch>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&Alright everybody, time for me$to return your tests.>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&It seems that Ana scored the highest of everybody.>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&Everyone clap for her>
SP0B1C0<>
SP0B1C41<Mr. SHin&Well everyone, make sure you study because we$will be having another test after the weekend>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Hey Hisao, how did you do on your test?>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Poorly. I did not know most of the stuff>
SP0B1C32<Ana&He he he, looks like there's something I can do better than you!>
SP0B1C32<Hisao&I guess you're right, I'm hopeless anyways>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Don't say that! You should never give up on yourself!>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Well it's easy for you to say,$Ms. I'm-Top-Of-The-Class!>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Don't call me names!>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Anyways, you need to get your grades up so that$you're no longer a failure.>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&And how am I supposed to do that?>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Because I am going to tutor you, of course>
SP0B1C32<Hisao&You're going to tutor me!?>
SP0B1C33<Ana&What, am I not smart enough? I'm going to be$reviewing anyways, not like I'm doing$anything special for you>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Ok, thank you very much!>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Don't thank me for that, stupid>
SP0B4C0<After Classes>
SP0B4C31<Ana&Now don't touch anything, you pervert>
SP0B4C31<Hisao&Wow! This room is spotless, even for a girl!>
SP0B4C35<Ana&W-what are you talking about, idiot. Of course$my room is spotless>
SP0B4C31<Ana&Anyways, stop distracting me and lets get to work>
SP0B0C0<>
SP0B4C33<Ana&Geez Hisao, why can't you understand this work>
SP0B4C33<Hisao&I'm trying! Give me one more question>
SP0B4C33<Ana&Ok here, you should do this ques->
SP0B4C35<Ana&WAHHH!> 
SP0B4C35<Hisao&What happened!>
SP0B4C35<Oh, nothing. Just forget that happened.>
SP0B4C35<Something's definitely up. Why would she freak$out like that when our hands touched...>
OP-100P0P100<Find out what's wrong><She would tell you if it was important><I'll figure it out later>*
SP-100B4C33<Ana&I already told you, it's nothing. Back off!>
SP-100B4C33<Hisao&Sorry, I was just curious.>
SP-100B4C31<Ana&Well cut it out, because I don't like$talking about it.>
SP-100B4C31<The rest of the session passed in awkward silence>
SP-100B0C0<>
SP-100B3C31<Hisao&Well thank you for tutoring me>
SP-100B3C32<Ana&No problem! Just don't fail>
SP-100B3C35<Ana&It's not because I want you to succeed, you'll just$make me look bad.>
SP-100B3C31<Hisao&Don't worry, I'll try my best not to let you down.>
SP-100B3C32<Ana&Ok, well goodnight then>
SP-100B3C0<Something is clearly wrong with Ana, and I feel like I$need to protect her.>
SP-100B3C0<Maybe I'll ask Christina about it tomorrow.>
SP-100B0C0<The need for sleep seems small in comparison to$finding out more about Ana's past.>
SP-100B1C21<Christina&Someone looks sleepy, did you pull an all-nighter?>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Or were you doing naughty stuff with Ana?>
SP-100B1C22<Hisao&oh shut up, we weren't doing anything wrong.>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ooo but you WERE doing something, then.>
SP-100B1C22<Hisao&well...yea, she was helping me study>
SP-100B1C21<Christina&boring, you two all alone in a room and$all you do is study?>
SP-100B1C21<Hisao&And when we were in your room all alone, what did we do?>
SP-100B1C25<Christina&Well...that was different>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ga ha ha! Anyways, you look like you need help$and you, my friend, have come to the right place.>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ask away, what do you want?>
SP-100B1C21<Hisao&Well, I want to know why Ana screamed when$I touched her hand>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&Oh...that...>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&You see, Ana is afraid of men>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&I hear it happened when she was little, she was$raised in a harsh sword family with an$abusive, and neglecting father>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&As the story goes, her father wanted a son and$thought that by raising his daughter like a boy,$she would be toughened up>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&However, the beatings made her weaker, and the$strict parenting made her rebel.>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&One particularily drunk night, her father came in to$her room mumbling something about not having a son.>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&...Sniff>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&He started to beat her senseless while she screamed$for help, but no one came>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&After that night, her mother enrolled her in this$K-12 school and she's been here ever since.>
SP-100B1C25<Christina&Now please don't tell Ana I told you that story,$we're on bad terms after what happened.>
SP-100B1C25<Hisao&Of course not! But thank you for letting me know>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Well, anything to give you a one-up on winning the lady.$Ga ha ha!>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&I gotta run, so I will see you later>
SP-100B1C0<How could I have known. I had tried confronting$her dark past, not knowing how serious it was>
SP-100B1C0<And what now? How can I face her after being so$rude.>
SP-100B1C31<Ana&Oi, Hisao. What are you spacing out for?>
SP-100B1C31<Hisao&Oh hi Ana, I was just...uhh...$talking with some friends>
SP-100B1C33<Ana&Don't lie to me!>
SP-100B1C32<Ana&Anyways, I don't have time to deal with all this$because I have tickets to the Summer Festival!>
SP-100B1C35<Ana&Since all my friends are busy this weekend, I guess$I can give you this ticket.>
SP-100B1C35<Ana&Do you want to come?>
OP-1P0P1<Why should I go with you when I'm an afterthought!><With you? That's a dream come true!><Yea sure, I don't mind>*
SP-101B1C33<Ana&Well fine, asshole! You don't have to come if you$don't want to. I'd hate to hold up you and Christina>
SP-101B1C33<Hisao&No, Ana, that's not what I meant>
SP-101B1C33<Ana&Guess what? I don't care! You are just a rude,$selfish prick who goes for anything that moves>
SP-101B1C33<Ana&I hope you enjoy being lonely, because I'm never$talking to you again!>
E
SP-100B1C31<Ana&Why're you being so creepy? Anyways,$be at the front gates this Friday at five and$we'll go from there>
SP-100B1C31<Hisao&Oh, uhh ok. Sounds good>
SP-100B0C0<The day of the festival has finally come and I am$looking forward to spending the weekend with Ana.>
SP-100B0C0<Ana, however, who seemed put off from how$I accepted the invitation was late>
SP-100B0C0<Trying to keep a light mood, I talk to her as we$head towards the park. But Ana seems$occupied with other things.>
SP-100B5C0<Wandering the stalls with Ana makes me feel like$we're a couple, and for a moment I forget myself$and reached for her hand.>
SP-100B5C0<Nothing could have prepared me for the shouting$and screaming as Ana spews angry remarks at me>
SP-100B5C0<I try apologizing, but she is already storming away.$What did I do wrong?>
E
SP-99B1C32<Ana&Awesome! I can't wait>
SP-99B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP-99B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like$seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>
SP-99B1C0<And I get to look forward to going to the festival$with her! This is going to be great!>
SP-99B0C0<After talking to Ana later, we decided to meet in$front of the park in the early evening.>
SP-99B5C0<I can't wait any longer, so I head over early to$the park after classes. But before I go in,$I notice someone looking around anxiously>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&Ana, you're here early>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Hmph! Upset that you don't get to spend some more time without me?>
SP-99B5C31<Though her tone sounded angry, I could definitely$see she had put on her good makeup and her$hair was shining in the sunlight>
SP-99B5C31<Hisao&No, I'm actually happy that we$get to spend more time together now, unless$you're waiting for anyone else>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&So do you want to visit some stalls or just walk around?>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&I hear they have really good cotton$candy at one stall, and another does shaved ice>
SP-99B5C32<Hisao&You seem to know what you want already,$are you that excited?>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP-99B5C31<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&You've never been to a festival with just a guy? Ha ha ha>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Don't laugh at me!>
SP-99B5C33<Hisao&I'm not laughing at you, it's just I thought I was$the only one nervous of it being a first time>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Oh...Well say so right away, idiot>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&See, I haven't been able to talk around boys before.>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&My family was not a nice place to grow up in.>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&I grew up cursing boys, and I just couldnt make$friends with them after that.>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&But then, how did you manage to talk to me at$the beginning of school?>
SP-99B5C31<Ana&I wasn't aware of what happened at the time, and$for some reason I could just keep talking to you>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&It just felt natural, talking to you>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&I just don't know if you should get too involved with me>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&No! Why would you say that nonsense.>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Well, I'm not the friendliest of people...>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&But you've been very friendly to me! You helped me$with my test!>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&Well...I'm not good at trusting other people...>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&But that won't matter if you just give me a chance!$Come on, Ana!>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&I'm not even pretty, why would you want someone like me?>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&Because you are beautiful to me, you are brilliant,$and the many other reasons that tell me that$I want to know you more!>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&I've never been one for romantics and the likes,$but I can't help but feel like there's more waiting$for you and I if you just give us a chance!>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP-99B5C32<Never before had holding hands felt like so much more,$like a thousand hidden possibilities and triumphs$sounding at once>
SP-99B5C32<And walking down the lane, holding hands>
SP-99B0C0<I only feel excited for what comes next>
E
SP0B4C35<Hisao&Man that static electricity, eh?>
SP0B4C35<Ana&Uhh yea, its pretty shocking, isnt it?>
SP0B4C35<Hisao&yea ha ha>
SP0B4C0<The rest of the session was spent reviewing, and$we didn't bring up what had just happened>
SP0B0C0<As I climb into bed, I can't help feel like that$scream was not just static>
SP0B3C0<Maybe I'll ask Christina about it tomorrow.>
SP0B0C0<Sleep then morphed into nightmares with Ana and Christina$swordfighting, blood everywhere...>
SP0B1C21<Christina&Someone looks sleepy, did you pull an all-nighter?>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Or were you doing naughty stuff with Ana?>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&oh shut up, we weren't doing anything wrong.>

SP100B1C32<Ana&Hey Hisao, What are you doing?>
SP100B1C32<Hisao&Oh hi Ana, I was talking with$some friends>
SP100B1C31<Ana&Oh, okay.>
SP100B1C31<Ana&Anyways, what are your plans for the weekend?>
SP100B1C32<Hisao&Nothing, I wasn't really planning anything special>
SP100B1C32<Ana&Thats great news!
SP100B1C32<Hisao&What's great news?>
SP100B1C35<Ana&Well...The thing is I have an extra ticket to the$Summer Festival and...since all my friends are busy$this weekend, I guess I can give you this ticket.>
SP100B1C35<Hisao&What?>
SP100B1C33<Ana&My god, you imbecile. Do you want to come to the Summer Festival with me?>
OP1P-1P0<"Oh, ok I'll go"><sure, I'd be happy to go with you><"Just the two of us? then it's a date">*
SP101B1C32<Ana&You would? That's great, I'm so excited!>
SP101B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP101B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like$seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>
SP101B1C0<And I get to look forward to going to the festival$with her! This is going to be great!>
SP101B0C0<After talking to Ana later, we decided to meet in$front of the park in the early evening.>
SP101B5C0<I can't wait any longer, so I head over early to$the park after classes. But before I go in,$I notice someone looking around anxiously>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&Ana, you're here early>
SP101B5C33<Ana&Hmph! Upset that you don't get to spend some more time without me?>
SP101B5C31<Though her tone sounded angry, I could definitely$see she had put on her good makeup and her$hair was shining in the sunlight>
SP101B5C31<Hisao&No, I'm actually happy that we$get to spend more time together now, unless$you're waiting for anyone else>
SP101B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in.>
SP101B5C31<Hisao&So I hear they have a great cotton candy stand, would you like some?>
SP101B5C32<Ana&Are you serious? I really wanted to go to that stall, lets get some!>
SP101B5C32<Hisao&Sounds good>
SP101B5C32<seeing Ana smile youthfully while eating cotton candy$puts my heart at ease, and we spend a while just$walking through the park and talking.>
SP101B5C32<Hisao&I don't think I've ever seen someone as excited for$a festival as you, waiting anxiously outside like that>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP101B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&You've never been to a festival with just a guy? Ha ha ha>
SP101B5C33<Ana&Don't laugh at me!>
SP101B5C31<Hisao&I'm not laughing at you, it's just I thought I was$the only one nervous of it being a first time>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Oh...Well say so right away, idiot>
SP101B5C34<Ana&See, I haven't been able to talk around boys before.>
SP101B5C34<Ana&My family was not a nice place to grow up in.>
SP101B5C34<Ana&I grew up cursing boys, and I just couldnt make$friends with them after that.>
SP101B5C34<Hisao&But then, how did you manage to talk to me at$the beginning of school?>
SP101B5C31<Ana&I wasn't aware of what happened at the time, and$for some reason I could just keep talking to you>
SP101B5C32<Ana&It just felt natural, talking to you>
SP101B5C34<Ana&I just don't know if you should get too involved with me>
SP101B5C34<Hisao&No! Why would you say that nonsense.>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Well, I'm not the friendliest of people...>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&But you've been very friendly to me! You helped me$with my test!>
SP101B5C34<Ana&Well...I'm not good at trusting other people...>
SP101B5C34<Hisao&But that won't matter if you just give me a chance!$Come on, Ana!>
SP101B5C35<Ana&I'm not even pretty, why would you want someone like me?>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&Because you are beautiful to me, you are brilliant,$and the many other reasons that tell me that$I want to know you more!>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&I've never been one for romantics and the likes,$but I can't help but feel like there's more waiting$for you and I if you just give us a chance!>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SP101B5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP101B5C35<And before I knew what was happening, we were kissing.$Lips locked in summer evening breeze, the mint of$her lipbalm driving me nuts.>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me...>
SP101B5C35<But before I could even get an acknowledgement,$she had pulled me back in and we were kissing$for what felt like an eternity>
SP101B5C32<My mind going blank, my body going numb, I just left$myself helplessly at the whim of this beautiful$assailant who stole my heart.>
SP101B5C32<Looking through tear-glazed eyes up at me, she$murmured something like "dont say sorry" and we laughed>
SP101B5C32<And turning back to the fair, hand-in-hand, I walked$back with Ana. Finally feeling happy for$coming to this school,>
SP101B5C32<Feeling happy for meeting Ana,>
SP101B5C32<And feeling happy for falling in love.>

SP100B1C32<Ana&Awesome! I can't wait>
SP100B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP100B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like$seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>
SP100B1C0<And I get to look forward to going to the festival$with her! This is going to be great!>
SP100B0C0<After talking to Ana later, we decided to meet in$front of the park in the early evening.>
SP100B5C0<I can't wait any longer, so I head over early to$the park after classes. But before I go in,$I notice someone looking around anxiously>
SP100B5C35<Hisao&Ana, you're here early>

SP100B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP100B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in>
SP100B5C35<Hisao&So do you want to visit some stalls or just walk around?>
SP100B5C32<Ana&I hear they have really good cotton$candy at one stall, and another does shaved ice>
SP100B5C32<Hisao&You seem to know what you want already,$are you that excited?>
SP100B5C33<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP100B5C31<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP100B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP100B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP100B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>

SP100B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SP100B5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP100B5C32<Never before had holding hands felt like so much more,$like a thousand hidden possibilities and triumphs$sounding at once>
SP100B5C32<And walking down the lane, holding hands>
SP100B0C0<makes me excited for what comes next>

SP99B1C31<Ana&Ugh why're you being so creepy? Anyways, be at the$front gates this Friday at five and we'll go from there>
SP99B1C31<Hisao&Oh, uhh ok. Sounds good>
SP99B0C0<The day of the festival has finally come and I am$looking forward to spending the weekend with Ana.>
SP99B0C0<Ana, however, who seemed put off from how$I accepted the invitation was late>
SP99B0C0<Trying to keep a light mood, I talk to her as we$head towards the park. But Ana seems$occupied with other things.>
SP99B5C0<Wandering the stalls with Ana makes me feel like$we're a couple, and for a moment I forget myself$and reached for her hand.>
SP99B5C0<Nothing could have prepared me for the shouting$and screaming as Ana spews angry remarks at me>
SP99B5C0<I try apologizing, but she is already storming away.$What did I do wrong?>
