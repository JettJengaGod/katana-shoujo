SP0B0C0<Morning light shone gently through the window shades, dancing merrily on the opposite wall. When was the last time I had slept so long>
SP0B0C0<Today would be the start of a new journey, the first day at my high school. I have been looking forward to this moment since I moved in last night.>
SP0B0C0<The blooming flowers filled the room with their aromatic fragrances as a slowly got out of bed and changed for my first day.>
SP0B0C0<Passing by my desk, I see my notebook open to my schedule: "8:30am - Meet with Mr. Shin; 9:00am - Classes" >
SP0B0C0<After showering and preparing for school, I opened my phone and checked the inbox.>
SP0B0C0<There is a new message from Mom and Dad: "we are so proud of you for being so independent. Good luck at school!">
SP0B0C0<Closing my phone, I leave for school...>
SP0B2C41<Mr. Shin&Good Morning, you must be Hisao. How was your first night in the dormitory?>
SP0B2C41<Hisao&My night was great, thanks for asking>
SP0B2C41<Mr. Shin&That is wonderful news, now the class is looking forward to meeting you. Are you ready?>
SP0B2C41<Hisao&I think so, I made sure I had everything packed yesterday.>
SP0B2C41<Mr. Shin&Great! Now before I introduce you, you need to know something about your class.>
SP0B2C41<Hisao&Uh...Ok? What is it?>
SP0B2C41<Mr. Shin&You see, some of the girls in this class are not your average, normal girls you would find in other schools.>
SP0B2C41<Mr. Shin&You could even say that they have "sharp" personalities. Ha ha ha>
SP0B2C41<Hisao&Umm...Thank you Mr. Shin for the warning>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&Attention class! Before we start this lesson, I would like to introduce a new student who will be with us from now on.>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&This is Tanaka Hisao, I hope everyone will help your new classmate come up to speed.>
SP0B1C0<After Class...>
SP0B1C0<Hisao&Man that class was hard, guess I'll head to the cafeteria.>
SP0B1C12<Kat&Wait! Hisao! Hi Hisao!>
SP0B1C12<Hisao&Oh hello there... WAH!>
SP0B1C0<Turning around to face a girl charging me, blade in hand, seemed to shake me more than I would think.>
SP0B1C15<Kat&I know it can be a bit startling at first, but I just wanted to come up and say hello!>
SP0B1C15<Hisao&Oh no, I'm so sorry! I did not mean to yell like that, that was very rude of me>
SP0B1C12<Kat&Don't worry about it! My name is Kat, by the way. Kat Shou. I guess I'll see you around then.>
SP0B1C12<Hisao&Yea, definitely! See you later>
SP0B1C0<Still holding the blade, she ran out the door, and turned the corner. I wonder why she has a sword... >
SP0B1C33<Ana&Ow! Watch where you're going, idiot!> 
SP0B1C33<Hisao&I'm sorr...>
SP0B1C33<...>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Watch where you're staring! You know it is rude to stare at someone, right?!>
SP0B1C33<Hisao&Oh! I'm so sorry, I did not mean it>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Well if you are truly sorry, then you can buy me lunch!> 
SP0B1C33<Hisao&What! oh...well, ok then>
SP0B1C0<This girl seems really rude, I wonder what's her deal ...besides the giant blade in her>
SP0B2C32<Hisao&So what do you want from the cafeter...>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Whoops! I'm so sorry, I did not mean to knock into you, silly me!> 
SP0B2C22<Hisao&It's ok, I did not see you either.>
SP0B2TC33C22<Ana&What are you spacing out for! What about my food, you waste of space!>
SP0B2TC33C23<Christina& Don't be so rude to the new student, Ana!>
SP0B2TC33C22<Christina& I'm sorry about that Hisao my name is Christina Moriarty, and please let me know if you need any help because I>
SP0B2TC33C23<Christina&...unlike some people, want to help>
SP0B2TC33C23<Ana&Hmph! Whatever, come on Hisao I want my food>
SP0B2C0<Seeing the disappointment in Christina as I followed Ana away made me feel bad, but a promise, is a promise.>
SP0B3C0<I can't help but feel exhausted after meeting so many weird people in so short a time, and what is with those katanas!>
SP0B3C0<Scared would be the right word, I guess. Just imagining those katanas stuck in me is enough to make me feel queasy>
SP0B3C0<But I feel bad treating them like creatures just because they carry those blades around>
SP0B3C0<It would not hurt to give these girls a chance. They seem normal enough to me, though Ana seemed a bit unfriendly>
SP0B3C0<Maybe I was just too unfamiliar with them I was gawking at them, which would be embarassing to anyone, really>
SP0B3C0<I guess I will just have to act like its normal from now on, to make sure I am not rude>
SP0B0C0<The Next Day>
SP0B1C11<Kat&Good Morning Hisao! How was your first day of school here?>
SP0B1C11<Hisao&It was great, I met some interesting people and found my classes ok. Even the cafeteria food is good!>
SP0B1C12<Kat&I'm happy to hear that! I was worried you would be feeling alone after coming to a new school without any friends>
SP0B1C12<Hisao&Thanks, I am happy to hear you were concerned about me, but I have been doing fine.>
SP0B1TC12C33<Ana&You shouldn't be pampering him like that, Kat. This idiot knocked into me yesterday, can you  believe it!>
SP0B1TC15C33<Kat&Oh don't be that way Ana, I'm sure Hisao didn't mean to bump into you on purpose!>
SP0B1TC15C33<Ana&Kat, you are way too trusting! I can't believe that you are sticking up for this filthy ape>
SP0B1TC13C33<Kat&Like you know would know what it means to be trusting at all, you nasty loner>
SP0B1TC13C35<Kat&Come on Hisao, tell her that she needs to treat you properly!>
OA1A2A3<"You're being too harsh Kat!"><"Yea Ana, treat me with respect!"><"Like I care what this filth says">*
A1
SP0B1TC14C32<Kat&Oh..Sorry, I guess I...Thought wrong...excuse me>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Thank you for saying that>
SP0B1C33<Ana&...But I didnt need your help, retard!>
SP0B1C33<Hisao&Uhh...Ok, it was no big deal>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Now come on, we are going to go get lunch, I'm starving.>
SP0B6C32<Ana&Man, don't you love the school's food?  It's great!>
SP0B6C32<Hisao&I guess, though aren't you bored of it after being here for so long?>
SP0B6C33<Ana&How could I grow tired of this food!? they make restaurant quality food here>
SP0B6C33<Hisao&Well I wouldn't say it is restaurant quality, but it sure is faster than me making it anyways>
SP0B6C32<Ana&You're able to make this food!? I thought you were completely useless!>
SP0B6C32<Hisao&Thanks, I guess...>
SP0B6C32<Ana&Then tomorrow, you will make me lunch.>
SP0B6C32<Hisao&Hey! I'm not your slave! I refuse to make it>
SP0B6C32<Ana&Gahh Home-made food! I'm so excited, I can't believe my luck.See you tomorrow for lunch!>
SP0B6C0<I can't help but feel like I'm being used by Ana, but I also can't help but feel sorry for her.>
SP0B2C0<As I enter the classroom, Christina is making funny faces at me from the back of the classroom>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Hey neighbor, that was one heck of an argument. You survive ok?>
SP0B2C22<Her wink makes me laugh in a way that makes me calm down and relax>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Yea, I'd say that I came out with only minor scrapes and bruises>
SP0B2C22<Christina&So what's a newbie such as yourself doing with so many girls at once? Trying to start a harem?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Yea? why, are you jealous?>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Ga ha ha, you are a real joker Hisao. I like it!>
SP0B2C22<Christina&So hotshot, what are your plans for this painfully boring day?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Nothing! I have no clue what to do in this place!>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Then you'll have no problem coming over after school to play cards?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Uhh...You're inviting a boy you just met into your house?>
SP0B2C25<Christina&Well sure, uhh, if you're interested in coming over tonight>
SP0B2C25<Hisao&Oh sure! I'd love to come over>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Ahh there's my boy! Ga ha ha ha, Then we'll head over after class!>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Sure!>
SP0B4C0<Passing the time with Christina was amazing, telling jokes and playing poker just like I was back with my friends.>
SP0B4C22<Christina&This was an amazing time, thank you for coming over>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&I can't remember the last time I had this much fun.>
SP0B4C22<Christina&Ga ha ha! Then it was a good thing you came! Maybe you can come over some other time for tea?> 
SP0B4C22<Hisao&Sure, why don't you give me your pho-HOLY CRAP IT'S LATE!>
SP0B4C22<Christina&I know, right? Time really flew!>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&You don't understand, if I leave the room now it will look like...umm...>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&...>
SP0B4C25<Christina&OH...right...well you need to sneak out, and don't get caught or...we're both in trouble...>
SP0B4C25<Hisao&Ok, I'll sneak out then, Goodnight Christina.>
SP0B4C25<Christina&...trouble...bad...>
SP0B4C25<Hisao&Christina? Are you okay?>
SP0B4C22<Christina&Oh, Ga ha ha! I'm ok of course, see you later Hisao!>
SP0B3C0<Something was definitely wrong with Christina, I wonder why she reacted that way...>
SP0B3C0<Oof!>
SP0B3C33<Ana&Hey! Watch where you're goin..Hisao!? What are you doing in the Girl's dorms?>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Uh well...>
SP0B3C33<Ana&Wait! Don't tell me you were just in Christina's room, you pig! I'm going back to bed>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&No Ana, this is a misunderstanding! Wait!...>
SP0B0C0<This is bad, I don't want Ana to get the wrong idea, but I also don't want to hurt Christina's feelings>
SP0B1C0<Today's class was hard to concentrate. I need to talk to Ana, make sure she's ok>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Ana, I need to talk to you. You have a moment?>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Do I have a moment for the scum of this earth? No,I don't think I do>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Please just listen Ana, I know it must have looked bad, me being in the Girl's dorm->
SP0B1C33<Ana&You bet it did!>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&-but I'm telling you, I didn't do anything>
SP0B1C31<Ana&You didnt?>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Yes, I promise>
SP0B1TC31C22<Christina&Hey Hisao! Thanks for everything yesterday!>
SP0B1TC33C22<Ana&And what is this "everything" that SHE's talking about?>
SP0B1TC33C25<Christina&Oh, its nothing Ana! Nothing!>
SP0B1TC33C25<Ana&Don't lie to me, I know something is up!>
SP0B1TC33C25<Hisao&Please, Ana, just listen for one second.>
SP0B1TC33C25<Ana&No, I'm done with you, you filthy ape>
SP0B1TC33C23<Christina&You know Ana, I don't think you're being very nice right now, why don't you back off!>
SP0B1TC33C23<Ana&Fine, maybe I will! Goodbye Hisao, hope you had fun>
SP0B1TC33C25<If Ana leaves right now, I don't think she'll ever forgive me, but running after her would definitely offend Christina.>
SP0B1TC33C25<What should I do?>
OA6A5A7<Chase after Ana><Leave her, Christina's right!><I'll deal with this later>*
A6
SP0B3C0<What was I thinking? She always treats me rudely>
SP0B3C0<Why am I running after her...>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Wait! Ana! Stop!>
SP0B3C33<Ana&What do you want>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Listen, you can hate me and not talk to me for the rest of high school, but please>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Hear me out.>
SP0B3C33<Ana&And why should I do that? Why should I trust you!>
SP0B3C33<Hisao&Because...Well, because...I don't know!>
SP0B3C31<Hisao&But I do know that I will do anything to prove that nothing happened!>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ana, wait! I just wanted to make sure you know that nothing happened between us!>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Your little Hisao is safe and sound, don't worry>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ga Ha Ha!>
SP0B3TC33C25<Ana&Hmph! It's not like I cared anyways>
SP0B3TC33C25<Ana&Well Hisao, I hope you brought me food because you owe me now>
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Hisao made food? I want some!>
SP0B3TC33C22<Ana&NO!..I mean, no you can't have them ...because they are mine.">
SP0B3TC31C22<Christina&Ga ha! I was only joking Ana, how greedy of you. Anyways, I'm going to go now, see you guys!>
SP0B3C31<Ana&Geez, she should learn to keep her nose out of my business. Anyways, let go Hisao.>
SP0B3C31<Hisao&Oh, ok>
SP0B1C0<After Lunch>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&Alright everybody, time for me to return your tests.>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&It seems that Ana scored the highest of everybody.>
SP0B1C41<Mr. Shin&Everyone clap for her>
SP0B1C0<>
SP0B1C41<Mr. SHin&Well everyone, make sure you study because we will be having another test after the weekend>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Hey Hisao, how did you do on your test?>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Poorly. I did not know most of the stuff>
SP0B1C32<Ana&He he he, looks like there's something I can do better than you!>
SP0B1C32<Hisao&I guess you're right, I'm hopeless anyways>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Don't say that! You should never give up on yourself!>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Well it's easy for you to say, Ms. I'm-Top-Of-The-Class!>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Don't call me names!>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Anyways, you need to get your grades up so that you're no longer a failure.>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&And how am I supposed to do that?>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Because I am going to tutor you, of course>
SP0B1C32<Hisao&You're going to tutor me!?>
SP0B1C33<Ana&What, am I not smart enough? I'm going to be reviewing anyways, not like I'm doing anything special for you>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Ok, thank you very much!>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Don't thank me for that, stupid>
SP0B4C0<After Classes>
SP0B4C31<Ana&Now don't touch anything, you pervert>
SP0B4C31<Hisao&Wow! This room is spotless, even for a girl!>
SP0B4C35<Ana&W-what are you talking about, idiot. Of course my room is spotless>
SP0B4C31<Ana&Anyways, stop distracting me and lets get to work>
SP0B0C0<>
SP0B4C33<Ana&Geez Hisao, why can't you understand this work>
SP0B4C33<Hisao&I'm trying! Give me one more question>
SP0B4C33<Ana&Ok here, you should do this ques->
SP0B4C35<Ana&WAHHH!> 
SP0B4C35<Hisao&What happened!>
SP0B4C35<Oh, nothing. Just forget that happened.>
SP0B4C35<Something's definitely up. Why would she freak out like that when our hands touched...>
OP-100P0P100<Find out what's wrong><She would tell you if it was important><I'll figure it out later>*
SP-100B4C33<Ana&I already told you, it's nothing. Back off!>
SP-100B4C33<Hisao&Sorry, I was just curious.>
SP-100B4C31<Ana&Well cut it out, because I don't like talking about it.>
SP-100B4C31<The rest of the session passed in awkward silence>
SP-100B0C0<>
SP-100B3C31<Hisao&Well thank you for tutoring me>
SP-100B3C32<Ana&No problem! Just don't fail>
SP-100B3C35<Ana&It's not because I want you to succeed, you'll just make me look bad.>
SP-100B3C31<Hisao&Don't worry, I'll try my best not to let you down.>
SP-100B3C32<Ana&Ok, well goodnight then>
SP-100B3C0<Something is clearly wrong with Ana, and I feel like I need to protect her.>
SP-100B3C0<Maybe I'll ask Christina about it tomorrow.>
SP-100B0C0<The need for sleep seems small in comparison to finding out more about Ana's past.>
SP-100B1C21<Christina&Someone looks sleepy, did you pull an all-nighter?>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Or were you doing naughty stuff with Ana?>
SP-100B1C22<Hisao&oh shut up, we weren't doing anything wrong.>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ooo but you WERE doing something, then.>
SP-100B1C22<Hisao&well...yea, she was helping me study>
SP-100B1C21<Christina&boring, you two all alone in a room and all you do is study?>
SP-100B1C21<Hisao&And when we were in your room all alone, what did we do?>
SP-100B1C25<Christina&Well...that was different>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ga ha ha! Anyways, you look like you need help and you, my friend, have come to the right place.>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Ask away, what do you want?>
SP-100B1C21<Hisao&Well, I want to know why Ana screamed when I touched her hand>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&Oh...that...>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&You see, Ana is afraid of men>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&I hear it happened when she was little, she was raised in a harsh sword family with an abusive, and neglecting father>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&As the story goes, her father wanted a son and thought that by raising his daughter like a boy, she would be toughened up>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&However, the beatings made her weaker, and the strict parenting made her rebel.>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&One particularily drunk night, her father came in to her room mumbling something about not having a son.>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&...Sniff>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&He started to beat her senseless while she screamed for help, but no one came>
SP-100B1C24<Christina&After that night, her mother enrolled her in this K-12 school and she's been here ever since.>
SP-100B1C25<Christina&Now please don't tell Ana I told you that story, we're on bad terms after what happened.>
SP-100B1C25<Hisao&Of course not! But thank you for letting me know>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&Well, anything to give you a one-up on winning the lady. Ga ha ha!>
SP-100B1C22<Christina&I gotta run, so I will see you later>
SP-100B1C0<How could I have known. I had tried confronting her dark past, not knowing how serious it was>
SP-100B1C0<And what now? How can I face her after being so rude.>
SP-100B1C31<Ana&Oi, Hisao. What are you spacing out for?>
SP-100B1C31<Hisao&Oh hi Ana, I was just...uhh... talking with some friends>
SP-100B1C33<Ana&Don't lie to me!>
SP-100B1C32<Ana&Anyways, I don't have time to deal with all this because I have tickets to the Summer Festival!>
SP-100B1C35<Ana&Since all my friends are busy this weekend, I guess I can give you this ticket.>
SP-100B1C35<Ana&Do you want to come?>
OP-1P0P1<Why should I go with you when I'm an afterthought!><With you? That's a dream come true!><Yea sure, I don't mind>*
SP-101B1C33<Ana&Well fine, asshole! You don't have to come if you don't want to. I'd hate to hold up you and Christina>
SP-101B1C33<Hisao&No, Ana, that's not what I meant>
SP-101B1C33<Ana&Guess what? I don't care! You are just a rude, selfish prick who goes for anything that moves>
SP-101B1C33<Ana&I hope you enjoy being lonely, because I'm never talking to you again!>
E
SP-100B1C31<Ana&Why're you being so creepy? Anyways, be at the front gates this Friday at five and we'll go from there>
SP-100B1C31<Hisao&Oh, uhh ok. Sounds good>
SP-100B0C0<The day of the festival has finally come and I am looking forward to spending the weekend with Ana.>
SP-100B0C0<Ana, however, who seemed put off from how I accepted the invitation was late>
SP-100B0C0<Trying to keep a light mood, I talk to her as we head towards the park. But Ana seems occupied with other things.>
SP-100B5C0<Wandering the stalls with Ana makes me feel like we're a couple, and for a moment I forget myself and reached for her hand.>
SP-100B5C0<Nothing could have prepared me for the shouting and screaming as Ana spews angry remarks at me>
SP-100B5C0<I try apologizing, but she is already storming away. What did I do wrong?>
E
SP-99B1C32<Ana&Awesome! I can't wait>
SP-99B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP-99B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>
SP-99B1C0<And I get to look forward to going to the festival with her! This is going to be great!>
SP-99B0C0<After talking to Ana later, we decided to meet in front of the park in the early evening.>
SP-99B5C0<I can't wait any longer, so I head over early to the park after classes. But before I go in, I notice someone looking around anxiously>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&Ana, you're here early>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Hmph! Upset that you don't get to spend some more time without me?>
SP-99B5C31<Though her tone sounded angry, I could definitely see she had put on her good makeup and her hair was shining in the sunlight>
SP-99B5C31<Hisao&No, I'm actually happy that we get to spend more time together now, unless you're waiting for anyone else>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&So do you want to visit some stalls or just walk around?>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&I hear they have really good cotton candy at one stall, and another does shaved ice>
SP-99B5C32<Hisao&You seem to know what you want already, are you that excited?>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP-99B5C31<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&You've never been to a festival with just a guy? Ha ha ha>
SP-99B5C33<Ana&Don't laugh at me!>
SP-99B5C33<Hisao&I'm not laughing at you, it's just I thought I was the only one nervous of it being a first time>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Oh...Well say so right away, idiot>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&See, I haven't been able to talk around boys before.>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&My family was not a nice place to grow up in.>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&I grew up cursing boys, and I just couldnt make friends with them after that.>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&But then, how did you manage to talk to me at the beginning of school?>
SP-99B5C31<Ana&I wasn't aware of what happened at the time, and for some reason I could just keep talking to you>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&It just felt natural, talking to you>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&I just don't know if you should get too involved with me>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&No! Why would you say that nonsense.>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Well, I'm not the friendliest of people...>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&But you've been very friendly to me! You helped me with my test!>
SP-99B5C34<Ana&Well...I'm not good at trusting other people...>
SP-99B5C34<Hisao&But that won't matter if you just give me a chance! Come on, Ana!>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&I'm not even pretty, why would you want someone like me?>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&Because you are beautiful to me, you are brilliant, and the many other reasons that tell me that I want to know you more!>
SP-99B5C35<Hisao&I've never been one for romantics and the likes, but I can't help but feel like there's more waiting for you and I if you just give us a chance!>
SP-99B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SP-99B5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP-99B5C32<Never before had holding hands felt like so much more, like a thousand hidden possibilities and triumphs sounding at once>
SP-99B5C32<And walking down the lane, holding hands>
SP-99B0C0<I only feel excited for what comes next>
E
SP0B4C35<Hisao&Man that static electricity, eh?>
SP0B4C35<Ana&Uhh yea, its pretty shocking, isnt it?>
SP0B4C35<Hisao&yea ha ha>
SP0B4C0<The rest of the session was spent reviewing, and we didn't bring up what had just happened>
SP0B0C0<As I climb into bed, I can't help feel like that scream was not just static>
SP0B3C0<Maybe I'll ask Christina about it tomorrow.>
SP0B0C0<Sleep then morphed into nightmares with Ana and Christina swordfighting, blood everywhere...>
SP0B1C21<Christina&Someone looks sleepy, did you pull an all-nighter?>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Or were you doing naughty stuff with Ana?>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&oh shut up, we weren't doing anything wrong.>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Ooo but you WERE doing something, then.>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&well...yea, she was helping me study>
SP0B1C21<Christina&boring, you two all alone in a room and all you do is study?>
SP0B1C21<Hisao&And when we were in your room all alone, what did we do?>
SP0B1C25<Christina&Well...that was different>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Ga ha ha! Anyways, you look like you need help and you, my friend, have come to the right place.>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Ask away, what do you want?>
SP0B1C21<Hisao&Well, I want to know why Ana screamed when I touched her hand>
SP0B1C24<Christina&Oh...that...>
SP0B1C24<Christina&You see, Ana is afraid of men>
SP0B1C24<Christina&I hear it happened when she was little, she was raised in a harsh sword family with an abusive, and neglecting father>
SP0B1C24<Christina&As the story goes, her father wanted a son and thought that by raising his daughter like a boy, she would be toughened up>
SP0B1C24<Christina&However, the beatings made her weaker, and the strict parenting made her rebel.>
SP0B1C24<Christina&One particularily drunk night, her father came in to her room mumbling something about not having a son.>
SP0B1C24<Christina&...Sniff>
SP0B1C24<Christina&He started to beat her senseless while she screamed for help, but no one came>
SP0B1C24<Christina&After that night, her mother enrolled her in this K-12 school and she's been here ever since.>
SP0B1C25<Christina&Now please don't tell Ana I told you that story, we're on bad terms after what happened.>
SP0B1C25<Hisao&Of course not! But thank you for letting me know>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Well, anything to give you a one-up on winning the lady. Ga ha ha!>
SP0B1C22<Christina&I gotta run, so I will see you later>
SP0B1C0<How could I have known. I had tried confronting her dark past, not knowing how serious it was>
SP0B1C0<And what now? How can I face her after being so rude.>
SP0B1C31<Ana&Oi, Hisao. What are you spacing out for?>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Oh hi Ana, I was just...uhh... talking with some friends>
SP0B1C33<Ana&Don't lie to me!>
SP0B1C32<Ana&Anyways, I don't have time to deal with all this because I have tickets to the Summer Festival!>
SP0B1C35<Ana&Since all my friends are busy this weekend, I guess I can give you this ticket.>
SP0B1C35<Ana&Do you want to come?>
OP-1P0P1<Why should I go with you when I'm an afterthought!><With you? That's a dream come true!><Yea sure, I don't mind>*
SP-1B1C33<Ana&Well fine, asshole! You don't have to come if you don't want to. I'd hate to hold up you and Christina>
SP-1B1C33<Hisao&No, Ana, that's not what I meant>
SP-1B1C33<Ana&Guess what? I don't care! You are just a rude, selfish prick who goes for anything that moves>
SP-1B1C33<Ana&I hope you enjoy being lonely, because I'm never talking to you again!>
E
SP1B1C32<Ana&Awesome! I can't wait>
SP1B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP1B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>
SP1B1C0<And I get to look forward to going to the festival with her! This is going to be great!>
SP1B0C0<After talking to Ana later, we decided to meet in front of the park in the early evening.>
SP1B5C0<I can't wait any longer, so I head over early to the park after classes. But before I go in, I notice someone looking around anxiously>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&Ana, you're here early>
SP1B5C33<Ana&Hmph! Upset that you don't get to spend some more time without me?>
SP1B5C31<Though her tone sounded angry, I could definitely see she had put on her good makeup and her hair was shining in the sunlight>
SP1B5C31<Hisao&No, I'm actually happy that we get to spend more time together now, unless you're waiting for anyone else>
SP1B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP1B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&So do you want to visit some stalls or just walk around?>
SP1B5C32<Ana&I hear they have really good cotton candy at one stall, and another does shaved ice>
SP1B5C32<Hisao&You seem to know what you want already, are you that excited?>
SP1B5C33<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP1B5C31<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP1B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP1B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP1B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&You've never been to a festival with just a guy? Ha ha ha>
SP1B5C33<Ana&Don't laugh at me!>
SP1B5C33<Hisao&I'm not laughing at you, it's just I thought I was the only one nervous of it being a first time>
SP1B5C35<Ana&Oh...Well say so right away, idiot>
SP1B5C34<Ana&See, I haven't been able to talk around boys before.>
SP1B5C34<Ana&My family was not a nice place to grow up in.>
SP1B5C34<Ana&I grew up cursing boys, and I just couldnt make friends with them after that.>
SP1B5C34<Hisao&But then, how did you manage to talk to me at the beginning of school?>
SP1B5C31<Ana&I wasn't aware of what happened at the time, and for some reason I could just keep talking to you>
SP1B5C32<Ana&It just felt natural, talking to you>
SP1B5C34<Ana&I just don't know if you should get too involved with me>
SP1B5C34<Hisao&No! Why would you say that nonsense.>
SP1B5C35<Ana&Well, I'm not the friendliest of people...>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&But you've been very friendly to me! You helped me with my test!>
SP1B5C34<Ana&Well...I'm not good at trusting other people...>
SP1B5C34<Hisao&But that won't matter if you just give me a chance! Come on, Ana!>
SP1B5C35<Ana&I'm not even pretty, why would you want someone like me?>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&Because you are beautiful to me, you are brilliant, and the many other reasons that tell me that I want to know you more!>
SP1B5C35<Hisao&I've never been one for romantics and the likes, but I can't help but feel like there's more waiting for you and I if you just give us a chance!>
SP1B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SPB5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP1B5C32<Never before had holding hands felt like so much more, like a thousand hidden possibilities and triumphs sounding at once>
SP1B5C32<And walking down the lane, holding hands>
SP1B0C0<I only feel excited for what comes next>
E
SP0B1C31<Ana&Why're you being so creepy? Anyways, be at the front gates this Friday at five and we'll go from there>
SP0B1C31<Hisao&Oh, uhh ok. Sounds good>
SP0B0C0<The day of the festival has finally come and I am looking forward to spending the weekend with Ana.>
SP0B0C0<Ana, however, who seemed put off from how I accepted the invitation was late>
SP0B0C0<Trying to keep a light mood, I talk to her as we head towards the park. But Ana seems occupied with other things.>
SP0B5C0<Wandering the stalls with Ana makes me feel like we're a couple, and for a moment I forget myself and reached for her hand.>
SP0B5C0<Nothing could have prepared me for the shouting and screaming as Ana spews angry remarks at me>
SP0B5C0<I try apologizing, but she is already storming away. What did I do wrong?>
E
SP100B4C35<Though her action worries me, it probably wouldn't be smart to just ask her out of the blue>
SP100B4C35<Hisao&Ha ha, well let's see this question>
SP100B4C31<Ana&Yes, let's see how you do on this one...>
SP100B4C31<Ana's poor attempt of concealing relief on her face made me feel grateful for not asking any further.>
SP100B0C0<But what was that? Why did she scream when I touched her?>
SP100B3C0<Maybe I'll ask Christina about it tomorrow.>
SP100B0C0<Though I tried sleeping, the sound of Ana screaming kept me up...>
SP100B1C21<Christina&Someone looks sleepy, did you pull an all-nighter?>
SP100B1C22<Christina&Or were you doing naughty stuff with Ana?>
SP100B1C22<Hisao&oh shut up, we weren't doing anything wrong.>

SP100B1C22<Christina&I gotta run, so I will see you later>
SP100B1C0<How could he have known? The poor girl has been bearing these burdens from her childhood.>
SP100B1C0<That something this tragic could happen to such a caring person as Ana...>
SP100B1C32<Ana&Hey Hisao, What are you doing?>
SP100B1C32<Hisao&Oh hi Ana, I was talking with some friends>
SP100B1C31<Ana&Oh, okay.>
SP100B1C31<Ana&Anyways, what are your plans for the weekend?>
SP100B1C32<Hisao&Nothing, I wasn't really planning anything special>
SP100B1C32<Ana&Thats great news!>
SP100B1C32<Hisao&What's great news?>
SP100B1C35<Ana&Well...The thing is I have an extra ticket to the Summer Festival and...since all my friends are busy this weekend, I guess I can give you this ticket.>
SP100B1C35<Hisao&What?>
SP100B1C33<Ana&My god, you imbecile. Do you want to come to the Summer Festival with me?>
OP1P-1P0<"Oh, ok I'll go"><sure, I'd be happy to go with you><"Just the two of us? then it's a date">*
SP101B1C32<Ana&You would? That's great, I'm so excited!>
SP101B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>
SP101B1C0<It was nice to see Ana this happy, it seems like seeing her happy makes me happier than anything else.>

SP101B5C33<Ana&I'm not waiting for anyone, stupid. I only invited you...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Well what are we waiting for! Let's go in.>
SP101B5C31<Hisao&So I hear they have a great cotton candy stand, would you like some?>
SP101B5C32<Ana&Are you serious? I really wanted to go to that stall, lets get some!>
SP101B5C32<Hisao&Sounds good>
SP101B5C32<seeing Ana smile youthfully while eating cotton candy puts my heart at ease, and we spend a while just walking through the park and talking.>
SP101B5C32<Hisao&I don't think I've ever seen someone as excited for a festival as you, waiting anxiously outside like that>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Shut up, why wouldn't I be excited? This is my first time>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&Your first time at a festival?>
SP101B5C33<Ana&No idiot, first time...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&You know...>
SP101B5C35<Ana&With a guy.>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&You've never been to a festival with just a guy? Ha ha ha>
SP101B5C33<Ana&Don't laugh at me!>

SP101B5C35<Ana&I'm not even pretty, why would you want someone like me?>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&Because you are beautiful to me, you are brilliant, and the many other reasons that tell me that I want to know you more!>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&I've never been one for romantics and the likes, but I can't help but feel like there's more waiting for you and I if you just give us a chance!>
SP101B5C35<Ana&Okay>
SP101B5C32<Ana&I think I can trust you>
SP101B5C35<And before I knew what was happening, we were kissing. Lips locked in summer evening breeze, the mint of her lipbalm driving me nuts.>
SP101B5C35<Hisao&I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me...>
SP101B5C35<But before I could even get an acknowledgement, she had pulled me back in and we were kissing for what felt like an eternity>
SP101B5C32<My mind going blank, my body going numb, I just left myself helplessly at the whim of this beautiful assailant who stole my heart.>
SP101B5C32<Looking through tear-glazed eyes up at me, she murmured something like "dont say sorry" and we laughed>
SP101B5C32<And turning back to the fair, hand-in-hand, I walked back with Ana. Finally feeling happy for coming to this school,>
SP101B5C32<Feeling happy for meeting Ana,>
SP101B5C32<And feeling happy for falling in love.>
E
SP100B1C32<Ana&Awesome! I can't wait>
SP100B1C35<Ana&...See you later!>

SP100B0C0<makes me excited for what comes next>

SP99B1C31<Ana&Ugh why're you being so creepy? Anyways, be at the front gates this Friday at five and we'll go from there>

SP0B1C25<My head is buzzing from what just happened, I need air.>
SP0B1C25<Christina&Hisao, where are you going?>
SP0B1C25<Hisao&...>
SP0B1C25<Christina&Hisao, you're pale! Lets go to the infirmary>
SP0B1C25<The ringing of her voice in your ears echos dully>
SP0B1C25<Then white noise started pouring in from somewhere>
SP0B1C25<I need air.>
SP0B1C25<Hisao&...Air>
SP0B1C0<And with the last lights fading from your vision, you plummet into darkness>

SP0B1TC12C34<Ana&I'm...I'm Sorry, I...I didn't mean it...>
SP0B1TC13C34<Kat&You're always like this Ana, why dont you go away>
SP0B1TC13C34<Ana&Ok...>
SP0B1C12<Kat&I'm sorry about that, Hisao, Ana can be rude sometimes>
SP0B1C12<Hisao&It's ok, thank you for standing up for me though. You are always there to lend a helping hand, aren't you?>
SP0B1C12<Kat&Of course I am, now why don't we go have lunch>
SP0B6C12<Kat&Ooo, they have my favorite sandwich on sale!>
SP0B6C12<Hisao&You okay? You seemed pretty upset back there>
SP0B6C11<Kat&Don't worry about me, I just don't like bullies>
SP0B6C11<Hisao&I'm sorry, that was insensitive to ask.>
SP0B6C12<Kat&No, it's ok. I'm happy that you're worried about me but please don't. I'll feel really bad about making a friend worry.>
SP0B6C12<Hisao&I can't just ignore a friend's suffering!>
SP0B6C14<Kat&Oh, I'm sorry Hisao, I really have to go. But if you want, you can come over tonight and we can talk about it>
SP0B6C14<Hisao&Oh sure, I'll meet up with you later then.>
SP0B6C12<Kat&Ok, Bye Hisao!>
SP0B2C0<As I enter the classroom, Christina is making funny faces at me from the back of the classroom>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Hey neighbor, that was one heck of an argument. You survive ok?>
SP0B2C22<Her wink makes me laugh in a way that makes me calm down and relax>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Yea, I'd say that I came out with only minor scrapes and bruises>
SP0B2C22<Christina&So what's a newbie such as yourself doing with so many girls at once? Trying to start a harem?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Yea? why, are you jealous?>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Ga ha ha, you are a real joker Hisao. I like it!>
SP0B2C22<Christina&So hotshot, what are your plans for this painfully boring day?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Nothing! I have no clue what to do in this place!>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Then you'll have no problem coming over after school to play cards?>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Uhh...You're inviting a boy you just met into your house?>
SP0B2C25<Christina&Well sure, uhh, if you're interested in coming over tonight>
SP0B2C25<Hisao&Oh sure! I'd love to come over>
SP0B2C22<Christina&Ahh there's my boy! Ga ha ha ha, Then we'll head over after class!>
SP0B2C22<Hisao&Sure!>
SP0B4C0<Passing the time with Christina was amazing, telling jokes and playing poker just like I was back with my friends.>
SP0B4C22<Christina&This was an amazing time, thank you for coming over>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&I can't remember the last time I had this much fun.>
SP0B4C22<Christina&Ga ha ha! Then it was a good thing you came! Maybe you can come over some other time for tea?> 
SP0B4C22<Hisao&Sure, why don't you give me your pho-HOLY CRAP IT'S LATE!>
SP0B4C22<Christina&I know, right? Time really flew!>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&You don't understand, if I leave the room now it will look like...umm...>
SP0B4C22<Hisao&...>
SP0B4C25<Christina&OH...right...well you need to sneak out, and don't get caught or...we're both in trouble...>
SP0B4C25<Hisao&Ok, I'll sneak out then, Goodnight Christina.>
SP0B4C25<Christina&...trouble...bad...>
SP0B4C25<Hisao&Christina? Are you okay?>
SP0B4C22<Christina&Oh, Ga ha ha! I'm ok of course, see you later Hisao!>
SP0B3C0<Something was definitely wrong with Christina, I wonder why she reacted that way...>
SP0B3C0<But something is bothering me, like I forgot something...Something important...>
SP0B3C0<KAT! I forgot about meeting Kat! What am I going to say to her when I see her next!?>
SP0B0C0<I can't get the thought of Kat's disappointment out of my head, her expecting me just for me  to not show up>
SP0B0C0<I just need sleep, I can worry about this tomorrow...>
SP0B1C0<Today's class was hard to concentrate, I kept looking over at Kat but it was like I did not even exist.>
SP0B1C0<Worry spreading and my inability to concentrate I just stared at the clock counting down the seconds until I could finally...>
SP0B1C11<Hisao&Kat! Wait up, Kat!>
SP0B1C11<Kat&Oh hi Hisao, nice weather today.>
SP0B1C11<Hisao&Listen, Kat! I know that I said I would come over last night, but I forgot. I'm really sorry>
SP0B1C11<Kat&Oh, well it wasn't that important anyways...>
SP0B1C11<Hisao&Don't say that, I want to hear what it was>
SP0B1C13<Kat&Oh, well now he wants to hear! Now that little ms. Cheery is not here!>
SP0B1C13<Speechless, I can't help but look down at my feet as I realized what she meant>
SP0B1C13<She knew.>
SP0B1C13<Hisao&Listen, I'm sorry that I forgot but please just calm down.>
SP0B1C14<Kat&I'm sorry, I just need to...>
SP0B1TC14C22<Christina&Hey Hisao! Kat! How are you guys doing?>
SP0B1TC14C22<Kat&I'm sorry, I need to leave.>
SP0B1TC14C22<Everything seems to be rushing by, I am not even sure what I can do...>
OA5A4A7<I can apologize later><Run after her!><Run away>*

SP0B1C22<Christina&I wonder why she was in a hurry.. Hey Hisa...>
SP0B1C0<The rush of wind from running away cut out all sounds as I tried running away>
SP0B2C0<Far Away>
SP0B2C0<If only I can just get away from these peop-BAM!>
SP0B2C51<Classmate&OH NO! I didn't mean to, I'm so sorry.>
SP0B2C51<Classmate&Oh god, there's blood everywhere!&Someone call an ambulance>
SP0B2C51<The voices were ringing, the feel of rubber and ashphalt licking my skin>
SP0B2C51<To think I would die of being run over by a car...>
SP0B2C0<The sounds and sights started to vanish, like on a cloud.>
SP0B0C0<And all was silent...>

SP0B1TC13C33<Ana&Excuse me! How dare you speak to me that way!>
SP0B1TC13C33<Kat&Ana's right! That was uncalled for Hisao!>
SP0B1TC13C33<Hisao&Whatever, you guys do what you want. I'm out>
SP0B1TC13C33<Kat&Wow, you're rude. Come on, Ana, lets get away from this asshole>
SP0B1C51<Classmate&Hey Hisao, lets go have lunch.>
SP0B6C51<Classmate&You really don't hold back when it comes this sort of stuff, do you?>
SP0B6C51<I can only shrug. It's not as if she's wrong.>
SP0B6C51<Classmate&Girl's hearts are delicate. You need to choose your words carefully, or else things like this happen.>
SP0B6C51<Classmate&Those two were pretty angry. I don't think apologizing would do you much good at this point, but you should really be more considerate in those types of situations.>
Sp0B6C0<I mull over her advice. The rest of our meal passes in silence, and by the time the bell rings I'm all too eager to leave.>
Sp0B6C0<I bid her a polite farewell. It is only as I am walking back to the class that I realize that I never learned her name...>
SP0B1C0<I re-enter the class and see Christina sitting in the back, making noise like usual.>
SP0B1C0<She waves me over, and I reluctantly go to her. The nagging voice in the back of my head says to just ignore her but those words...>
SP0B1C0<That classmate said I should be kinder.>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Quite the scene this morning, don't you think?>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&I don't know... I guess? They were being rude to me, not my fault>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Ga ha ha, it sounded like the opposite from here!>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&so what do you want?>
SP0B1C22<Christina&Just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out later!>
SP0B1C22<Hisao&No I can't, I'm...busy>
SP0B1C24<Christina&Oh...Ok, if you're busy. Too bad, I kinda wanted  to get to know you>
OA5A7A7<Sorry, maybe some other time><Oh But I can hang out tomorrow><But I don't want to know you, beat it!>*
A7
SP0B1C24<Hisao&Yea, maybe some other time. Sorry>
SP0B1C24<I knew it was a lie, I felt no particular reason to even talk to her, but I wanted to be polite>
SP0B1C24<I just don't know what to expect from these crazy girls, on my first day here.>
SP0B1C24<Christina&Well ok, I guess I'll talk to you later then>
SP0B1C24<Hisao&Yea, sure>
SP0B1C0<As she left, I realized just far I had fallen.>
SP0B1C0<All of these girls were so nice to me, had treated me with kindness and respect.>
SP0B1C0<And this is how I repay them? Being rude and reclused?>
SP0B1C0<Maybe I don't deserve to have friends at all...>
SP0B0C0<I guess I don't deserve to live...>

SP0B1C24<I am just done with all these meddling girls and their need to be recognized>
SP0B1C23<Christina&Well fine then, snap at me why don't you>
SP0B1C23<Christina&You'll be a lonely man for the rest of your life!>
SP0B1C23<Hisao&Better that than somebody who can't keep her nose out of my business long enough to know this:>
SP0B1C23<Hisao&I...Don't...Car->
SP0B1C23<It was pretty obvious by the flash of metal I had gone too far, but I kept going>
SP0B1C23<Hisao&And furthermore...>
SP0B1C23<Christina&Dont...say...another...word>
SP0B1C23<Hisao&FURTHERMORE, I don't think a girl like you would even be worth my troub->
SP0B1C23<And it was over. The blood running down her sword, and my sleeve, told me that much>
SP0B1C23<Some students screamed, some fainted, but she just stood there.>
SP0B1C23<Standing stone-faced and white-lipped>
SP0B1C0<And that was it. The last lights flickered out and all was still.>
