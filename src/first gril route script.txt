SP0B2C14<The move is instinctive. My hand shoots out, firmly grasping a frail wrist. I'm speechless. What could I say? For a tense moment, we simply stand there.>
SP0B2C14<The slight glistening in her eyes jar me from my trance.>
SP0B2C14<Hisao&Look, Kat, I... >
SP0B2C14<The words die in my throat. What possible excuse could I have? I made a promise and I didn't keep it.>
SP0B2C11<Kat&Hisao, it's fine, really. You had something else to do and couldn't make it. I understand, honest.>
SP0B2C11<Aside from slightly moist eyes, she appeared&surprisingly collected. An astounding recovery.>
SP0B2C11<My eyes are drawn to the hand grasping the sheathe. The knuckles are blanched white with exertion. Apparently not as recovered as I had thought.>
SP0B2C11<Hisao&Kat, I'm really sorry. I know, I messed up. I got distracted and lost track of time. I'll do whatever you want as an apology, so please don't be angry.>
SP0B2C11<Kat&Anything?>
SP0B2C11<Her voice holds a tone of scepticism, but her clenched fist loosens on the blade.>
SP0B2C11<Kat&So if I were to cut you down right now...?>
SP0B2C11<I can feel my face drain of blood>
SP0B2C11<Hisao&I...Would much rather that didn't happen...>
SP0B2C12<Finally, her face brightens in genuine mirth>
SP0B2C12<Kat&I wouldn't actually cut you, silly! Your expression was just too funny!>
SP0B2C12<Hisao&Eh, it doesn't seem like as much of a joke when it could actually happen.>
SP0B2C12<Kat&How rude! I wouldn't kill anybody for no reason!>
SP0B2C12<Hisao&I'm kidding, kidding.>
SP0B2C12<Hisao&As i watch her laugh, I feel a lightness in my chest. A knot of anxiety unravels in me.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Christina&Well, I'm glad to see that crisis averted.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Christina, almost forgotten finally speaks up.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Christina&I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any misunderstandings between you two. I was just trying to get to know the new guy.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Kat&No! I'm the one who should be sorry, I completely overreacted. Please, don't feel bad.>
SP0B2TC11C22<I watch in amusement as the two girls start hastily apologizing to each other.>
SP0B2TC11C22<As if suddenly remembering me, Kat breaks off and addresses me.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Kat&You can make it up to me tonight. Come by my place and we will hang out.>
SP0B2TC11C22<Fo' Shizzle.>
SP0B0C0<The day passes quickly and I find myself at the girl's dorm.>
SP0B4C11<I get to Kat's room just as she is rushing out. She pauses for a moment to greet me.>
SP0B4C11H<Kat&Oh! Hi Hisao! Sorry, I need to go help Yumi...My friend down the hall for a bit. Just go ahead and make yourself at home!>
SP0B4C11<Hisao&Will do.>
SP0B4C10<I step into her room.>
SP0B4C51<I notice an item that Kat had dropped earlier in her haste. It's an opened letter. From the looks of it, she had tried to crumple it up. My curiosity  gets the better of me, and I smooth out the wrinkles on her desk.>
SP0B4C51<We settle the score at Braver's Plain. I will wait for you a week from now at dusk. Do not disappoint me. -K>
SP0B4C51<What sort of score would a girl like Kat have to settle with anyone? She didn't seem like the type to pick random fights with people.>
SP0B4C51<I'm fairly certain this is a writ of challenge. I had heard of Braver's Plain; it's a secluded section of the forest that is a popular duelling grounds.>
SP0B4C51<I feel uneasy. On one hand, this could be a stupid misunderstanding, and on the other Kat may actually be in danger.>
OP100P-1000P0<Confront Kat.><Deal with it yourself.><Ignore it.>*
SP-1000B4C0<I don't like this. This whole situation feels wrong to me.>
SP-1000B4C0<I try to calm down, but the image of the letter keeps popping into my mind.>
SP-1000B4C1<The door pops open and Kat returns, slightly exasperated.>
SP-1000B4C1<Kat&Sorry about that, Yumi is a good girl, but she can be a bit helpless sometimes.>
SP-1000B4C1<Hey, it's no problem. Look, I'm really sorry but something just came up, I'm going to have to leave early.>
SP-1000B4C1<Kat&Aw, and I was so looking forward to being able to hang out with you. You only just got here!>
SP-1000B4C1<She pouts dejectedly, plopping onto her bed and bouncing up and down slightly.>
SP-1000B4C1<Hisao&Yea, I know, I'm really sorry Kat. This is really important. I promise, I'll make it up to you, alright?>
SP-1000B4C1<Kat&Well, alright, see you Hisao. I'll be sure to make you make up for this, you know.>
SP-1000B4C1<She smiles cheekily as she says goodbye from her perch on the bed.>
SP-1000B4C1<Hisao&Yea, sorry again, Kat.>
SP-10000B7C51<Sitting in my room, I mull over the letter. It's ominous no matter which way you look at it.>
SP-1000B9C0<As I thought, there was no way I could let Kat go do anything this dangerous by herself. She was too gentle to be a fighter. I had to do something before anyone got hurt.>
SP-1000B9C0<The note said that this person would wait at the Braver's Field at dusk in a week's time.>
SP-1000B9C0<I had heard of Braver's Field. It was a clearing a good distance into the forest that was a popular spot for one-on-one duels. 
SP-1000B9C0<The solution was simple. I just had to go there in Kat's place and maybe try and talk this out. Hopefully, whoever it was would be reasonable.>
SP-1000B9C0<If not...I would figure that out when the time came.>
SP-1000B0C0<The following week seemed to pass in an anxious blur. I couldn't recall much of anything that happened in that time. Somehow I managed.>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat&...sao?Hisao? Hey! Hisao!>
SP-1000B9C11<An exasperated voice broke me out of my musings. Not good, I had spaced out again.>
SP-1000B9C11C11<Hisao&Eh? Huh? What's up, Kat?>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat&Are you OK, Hisao? You've been acting strange recently. Is something on your mind?>
SP-1000B9C11<Hisao&Eh? Strange how?>
SP-1000B9C11<I sneak a look at my watch as I respond. 6:30 P.M. Less than an hour left.>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat&Well, you've been looking at your watch a lot today, for one.>
SP-1000B9C11<Damn. So she had noticed.>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat&That, and you've been really out of it for this last week. Whenever someone tries to talk to you, you give some vague answer before drifting off again.>
SP-1000B9C11<I shrug, trying to appear unperturbed.>
SP-1000B9C11<Hisao&I've got a lot of stuff going on. Classes are a pain in the ass and I just have far too much stuff to do and not enough time.>
SP-1000B9C11<Hisao&The only reason I keep checking my watch is because I have to meet with a teacher for a make-up lesson in less than an hour.>
SP-1000B9C11<The ease with which I was able to spout such lies bothered me a bit. I tried to assure myself that it was for a good cause.>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat looks at me strangely but lets it go.>
SP-1000B9C11<Kat&You should probably get ready then, you don't want to be late.>
SP-1000B9C11<Hisao&Mhmmm>
SP-1000B9C11<I hum an affirmative.>
SP-1000B7C11<Kat bids me good luck at the entrance to the dorm. I head off, not in the direction of the school, but towards the forest.>
SP-1000B5C0<Braver's Field is empty when I finally arrive. The sun is hanging low in the sky and the orange glow casts long shadows on the trees.>
SP-1000B5C0<I pick an arbitrary spot and sit, waiting for this mystery person to arrive.>
SP-1000B5C0<I wait an hour. And then two. The sun has long since set at this point, and heavy clouds cover an already-weak moon.>
SP-1000B5C0<A no-show after all, huh?>
SP-1000B5C0<Sighing wearily, I climb to my feet, stretching and popping my stiff joints.>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&Don't turn around.>
SP-1000B5C0<I freeze. A very sharp, very metal point is digging into the back of my neck.>
SP-1000B5C0<The voice was feminine and spoke in curt, clipped sentences. This was not the voice of mercy.>
SP-1000B5C0<I speak placatingly,>
SP-1000B5C0<Hisao&Look, I just came here to talk, so...>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&Silence.>
SP-1000B5C0<I comply.>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&This was to be an honorable duel between those who follow the way of the blade. Instead you choose to tarnish my honor by appearing here yourself.>
SP-1000B5C0<Hisao&If you would just let me...>
SP-1000B5C0<I cut my sentence short as the blade digs into my skin. I can feel a droplet of blood trickle down my back.>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&I believe I told you to remain silent.>
SP-1000B5C0<Her voice is a cold, dangerous hiss.>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&I will give you a choice. I came here to battle, and I intend to do just that. You can either oblige me, or you can die here.>
SP-1000B5C0<I feel the pressure vanish. Cautiously I turn my head. In the shadows I can only make out a dark silhouette.>
SP-1000B5C0<The mystery woman offers me a gleaming blade before taking up her own. I suppose I have no choice.>
SP-1000B5C0<I heft the katana in my right hand. It's an unfamiliar weight. An alien feel. I shift into a stance that I hope is somewhat passable.>
SP-1000B5C0<The flash of her blade in the scant light is the only indication that my opponent has moved.>
SP-1000B5C0H<Just barely, I lift my sword to deflect her assault. My arms feel sluggish. The weight of her blow is unexpectedly heavy.>
SP-1000B5C0H<I reel backwards, my arms dropping. I cannot fend off her next assault, and I can feel her blade slash my legs on the backswing.>
SP-1000B5C0H<Hisao&ARRRGHHHHHHH!!!>
SP-1000B5C0H<Immediately, I drop to the ground, grasping at the lacerated flesh. Distantly, I can hear myself screaming, but I can only focus on the burning pain in my legs.>
SP-1000B5C0<Assailant&Perhaps you should know.>
SP-1000B51C0<A sliver of moonlight pierces the oppressive clouds. As my vision dims I see a shadow stand over me menacingly>
SP-1000B51C0<Assailant&That girl which you thought you needed to save is unbelievably powerful. She currently holds the title as the strongest swordswoman in the school.>
SP-1000B51C0<Assailant&Did you truly think that such a person needed the protection of one such as you?>
SP-1000B51C0<Like an executioner, the shadow lifted her blade to the heavens.>
SP-1000B51C0<Assailant&Know your place, scum.>
SP-1000B51C0<The flash of her blade is blindingly brilliant as it streaks down one final time.>

SP100B4C51<As I finish reading the letter. Kat walks back into the room.>
SP100B4C11<Kat&Sorry, I....What are you doing??>
SP100B4C15<Hisao&Kat, what is this?>
SP100B4C15<Answer my question first! Why are you reading my things?>
SP100B4C15<Look, I'm sorry, but I can't just ignore this.>
SP100B4C15<It...It's a writ of challenge. I was called out to fight in a duel.>
SP100B4C15<Kat...I believe in you.>
SP100B4C12<Kat&Waaai, I knew you would understand. I love you Hisao!>
SP100B0C0<Kat won her duel. She killed her opponent and then we got married. The End.>
E
SP0B4C51<Hisao&Eh? What is this? Some sort of joke?>
SP0B4C51<Kat walks back into the room and I hastily shove the letter into my pocket.>
SP0B4C11<Kat&I'm back Hisao! What's wrong? Are you feeling OK? You are sweating a lot.>
SP0B4C511<Hisao&Ah...I'm fine! I'm just a bit tired from the walk here is all.>
SP0B4C511<Kat&Haha, you're silly. You should probably start working out if that got you tired.>
SP0B4C511<Hisao&Yea, probably.>
SP0B4C51<We spend the rest of the night talking about random things and having a good time in general.>
SP0B7C0<When I get home, I remember the letter that I have in my pocket. I pull it out and read it again. It doesn't really seem like a joke.>
SP0B7C0<What if she's actually in danger? I didn't say anything! If she gets hurt, it will all be my fault!>
SP0B7C0<The guilt is overwhelming.>
SP0B7C0H<I jump up and start rummaging through my desk. I find the gun I keep in case a rapist comes in my window. My only salvation.>
SP0B7C0<I press the gun to my head. I will pay for my mistake here!>
SP0B7C0<Hisao&Per...So...Na...>
SP0B7C0<I pull the trigger and then I die.>
